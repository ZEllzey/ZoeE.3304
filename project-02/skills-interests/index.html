            <h2>Some of my favorite books and games</h2>

            <p>This is a curated collection of books and games that I love. They're all important to me, either as new books I fell in love with or favorites since childhood.</p>

                    <p>One of my favorite books I recently acquired. It's meant to be used to fill out a D&D world with real and fantasy plants.
                        It provides descriptions for each plant, diagrams of different parts, medicinal and magical uses, methods for collection,
                        and cultural signifigance. It has been a really good tool for helping me roleplay my druid in the D&D game I'm currently
                        playing in.</p>

                    <p>This book a a different take on the lives of supernatural beings and the social politics of the immortals. The two main 
                        characters and a vampire that is a realastate agent, and the godson of death, who is definetly ot just a regular mortal.
                        This book has death, undeath, heart break, and forbidden love. This book beautifully displace how even though people are not 
                        perfect that does not mean they don't deserve happiness and love.</p>

                    <p>This is currently one of my favorite books. It features a female apothecary from the 1790s and 
                        a female history finatic from current times. I love the tragic story of a place of healing turning into 
                        a source of death. I have based my current DND charcter off this book and I truly love it.</p>

                    <p>This book is about a young girl that is taken in by a family in Germany in the midst 
                        of World War II. It follows her experience learning to read and learn to help her adoptive family 
                        hide the jew they are concealing in their basement. This book is important to me because it changed
                        my view on death. Also while this book is fiction it is based of real accounts of events that happened
                        during the holocaust. It is heartbreakingly tragic and beautiful.</p>

                    <p>This book is about a lonely librarian who discovers the generations long curse on the women in his family 
                        and is life threatening fight to end it and save his sister. I love this book and the dramatic whimsical themes throughout it.
                        It dives into some historical fiction about how traveling circuses where formed, and the tragedy that often followed them.
                        If you can't tell I love books about tragedy and fighting for those you love.</p>

                    <p>The game ws one of me and my sisters favorite games to play growing up. We would pay it on our 
                        Nintendo Wii for hours. This game goes through the polt off all of the Pirates or the Caribbean Movies.
                        It is full of puzzles, fighting, cooperative games and chase scenes. 
                        It is a game I will always go back and replay as it is near and dear to me.</p>
