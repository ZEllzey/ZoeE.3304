        <h1>Tamu.edu vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize"
            <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">tamu.edu</a>. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./A&M-vandalism.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Changes made:
        <ul>
            <li>I edited the headline of their page to just reference the fact a guy in the video it plays is wearing a suit.</li>
            <li>Changed the colors of their button elements, their banner, and the border elements of their section dividers (the small orange triangle above standing together for good).</li>
            <li>Increased the font size of their navigation links at the top.</li>
            <li>Tried to spice up the page with some fun new colors I think they'd absolutely love.</li>
            <li>It was interesting to see how their stylesheet and page were formatted, especially with elements that change colors when you hover over them.</li>
        </ul>
