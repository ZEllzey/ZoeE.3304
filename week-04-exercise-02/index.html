                    One of my favorite books I recently acquired. It's meant to be used to fill out a D&D world with real and fantasy plants.
                    It provides descriptions for each plant, diagrams of different parts, medicinal and magical uses, methods for collection,
                    and cultural signifigance. It has been a really good tool for helping me roleplay my druid in the D&D game I'm currently
                    playing in.

                    This game was unexpectedly fun and a great way to enjoy the Indiana Jones universe from a different
                    perspective. I had zero expectations and didn't play it immediately after release, but I'm glad I
                    decided to buy it when it went on sale. Was it a perfect game? No! But was it an engaging
                    single-player experience that let me pretend I was an adventurous archaeologist? Yes! And
                    really,that's all you need from a game, right? <em>**cracks whip emphatically!**</em>

                <p class="description">
                    This is currently one of my favorite books. It features a female apothecary from the 1790s and 
                    a female history finatic from current times. I love the tragic story of a place of healing turning into 
                    a source of death. I have based my current DND charcter off this book and I truly love it.

                    The game ws one of me and my sisters favorite games to play growing up. We would pay it on our 
                    Nintendo Wii for hours. This game goes through the polt off all of the Pirates or the Caribbean Movies.
                    It is full of puzzles, fighting, cooperative games and chase scenes. 
                    It is a game I will always go back and replay as it is near and dear to me.

                <p class="description">
                    This book is about a young girl that is taken in by a family in Germany in the midst 
                    of World War II. It follows her experience learning to read and learn to help her adoptive family 
                    hide the jew they are concealing in their basement. This book is important to me because it changed
                    my view on death. Also while this book is fiction it is based of real accounts of events that happened
                    during the holocaust. It is heartbreakingly tragic and beautiful.

                    This book is about a lonely librarian who discovers the generations long curse on the women in his family 
                    and is life threatening fight to end it and save his sister. I love this book and the dramatic whimsical themes throughout it.
                    It dives into some historical fiction about how traveling circuses where formed, and the tragedy that often followed them.
                    If you can't tell I love books about tragedy and fighting for those you love.
